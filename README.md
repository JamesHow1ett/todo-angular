Hello, my name is Oleksandr Skorokhod. I'm a front-end developer. There is my first touch the Angular. There is a list of Angular features that I have used while developing:

 -  Two-way binding.
 -  Content Projection.
 -  Component Lifecycle.

This challenge opened my eyes to these things:

 - Understanding how Angular works.
 - How to deploy to Netlify.

That's all folks!
